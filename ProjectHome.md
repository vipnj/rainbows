Source files corresponding to the current release of the recursive flow rainbow visualizer - a demo application built in AS3 using Eclipse + FDT, Ant and the Flex 3 SDK.

The application is available to view online at http://www.recursiveflow.com/rainbows/

The files in the libs directory represent a subset of the recursive flow shared code library. When completed, this will be made available as a separate project.

Documentation is currently fairly minimal and only touches on the role of each class.
